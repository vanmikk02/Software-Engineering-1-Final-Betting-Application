# Software-Engineering-1-Final-Betting-Application
An application created for my Software Engineering 1 Class at Western Colorado University. 

To install unzip the file and place it into a Java IDE of your choosing. Application runs off of the Main file.

Once you run the application you must create an account to enter into the database. Username must be unique for the account to be created. Once logged in you are able to choose between two games.
Coin flip game. Enter your bet amount and then place your bet on either heads or tails. If you win you triple the amount betted and if you lose you lose everything you betted
Dice bet game. Enter your bet amount and then place your bet on 1-6 side of the die. If you win you triple the amount betted and if you lose you lose everything you betted
There is a leaderboard that accesses the players in the database and ranks them based on their amount of money won as well as the number of wins and losses that they have. 
If you go bankrupt your account is entirely cleared of balance, wins, and losses.

Uses a database to store accounts.
